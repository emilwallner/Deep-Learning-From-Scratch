# Deep Learning From Scratch

There are six snippets of code that made deep learning what it is today. [Coding the History of Deep Learning](https://medium.com/@emilwallner/the-history-of-deep-learning-explored-through-6-code-snippets-d0a0e8545202) covers the inventors and the background to their breakthroughs. In this repo, you can find all the code samples from the story.

1. **The Method of Least Squares**: The first cost function
1. **Gradient Descent**: Finding the minimum of the cost function
1. **Linear Regression**: Automatically decrease the cost function
1. **The Perceptron**: Using a linear regression type equations to mimic a neuron
1. **Artificial Neural Networks**: Leveraging backpropagation to solve non-linear problems
1. **Deep Neural Networks**: Neural networks with more than one hidden layer
